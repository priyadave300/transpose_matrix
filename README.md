Please write a function named transpose(matrix: list), which takes a two-dimensional integer array, i.e., a matrix, as its argument. The function should transpose the matrix. Transposing means essentially flipping the matrix over its diagonal: columns become rows, and rows become columns.

The matrix is a square matrix, so it will have an equal number of rows and columns.
